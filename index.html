			<h1>Scientists make 'insanely exciting' star discovery</h1>

			<p class="lead">Scientists have discovered 44 previously unknown stars which had been hidden behind a cluster of galaxies.</p>

			<p>Physicists at Durham University helped discover the stars in the Dragon Arc galaxy nearly 6.5 billion light-years from Earth as part of an international research project.</p>

			<p>Pictures show how the stars look during a period known as the cosmic noon - the middle ages of the universe when the most stars were born.</p>

			<p>The Durham team was led by physicists <b>David Lagattuta</b> and <b>Mathilde Jauzac</b>, who said discovering the stars was <i>"insanely exciting"</i>.</p>

			<p><i>"I see it first of all with the eyes of a little girl, in the sense that what we see is absolutely fascinating and absolutely amazing,"</i> said Prof Jauzac.</p>

			<p><i>"Second, as a scientist I see it as such a success for our field."</i></p>

			<p><i>"We have made so much progress that now we are able to help and work with people, in stellar physics for example, to detect individual stars."</i></p>
			
			<p>Dragon Arc is located behind a cluster of galaxies called Abell 370.</p>

			<p>The cluster is so large it stretches and magnifies the light from Dragon Arc through an effect known as gravitational lensing.</p>

			<p>Durham University described the effect as working like a "hall of mirrors of cosmic proportions".</p>

			<p>The magnified images were then photographed by the James Webb Space Telescope, which allowed scientist to identify the stars.</p>

			<p>Dr Jauzac said the cosmic noon is the period when the number of stars created in the universe is highest, but observing these celestial bodies has proved difficult.</p>

			<p><i>"This very particular type of star we have detected in the Dragon Arc, called red supergiants, are very difficult to observe because they are surrounded by a lot of dust and this dust basically makes them invisible to standard instruments,"</i> she said.</p>

			<p><i>"Being able to observe the stars at this epoch would give us a lot of clues about their role, what they are doing and how they enriched the universe at that time."</i></p>

			<h2>'Cosmic lighthouse'</h2>

			<p>Individual stars outside of the Milky Way have been observed before but usually only one or two at a time.</p>

			<p>Dr Lagattuta said the sheer number of stars found was "quite special" as it allowed scientists to extract properties of the entire stellar population more easily and accurately.</p>

			<p>Gravitational lensing also provides information about the mass of Abell 370 and the dark matter within it.</p>

			<p><i>"We can use these stars as a kind of cosmic lighthouse to see where the dark matter is and how much there is, giving us new information about the substance that holds the universe together,"</i> he added.</p>
